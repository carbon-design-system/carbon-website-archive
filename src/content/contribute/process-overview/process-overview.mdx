## Introduction

Carbon is an open source design system. It's free to use for anybody building on the web, and we're always working to make it better. Contributors like you are what make Carbon great, and we're glad you're here.

Contributions don't have to be code. We encourage feedback, documentation, design, tools, and code.

All you need is a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to submit. Most contributions begin with a GitHub issue, and that's a great place to start:

* [Ask a question](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+question+%3Aquestion%3A&template=question.md&title=)
* [Request a feature](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement+%F0%9F%92%A1&template=feature-request-or-enhancement.md&title=)
* [Report a bug](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+bug+%F0%9F%90%9B&template=bug-report.md&title=)


### Working with GitHub

Carbon lives on GitHub. All work, discussion, issues, bugs, features, improvements, and comments should happen right out in the open where anybody can see. You'll need a public GitHub account to contribute.

Our typical workflow is something along these lines:

1. All work begins with a GitHub issue. We have a several GitHub templates to get you started.
2. 

Carbon Design System projects typically use a fork and pull request workflow for contributions. Specific instructions can be found in each project’s GitHub CONTRIBUTING.md file. 

## Writing an issue

## Contributor License Agreement

We require contributors outside of IBM to sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before code contributions can be reviewed and merged. If you have questions, please [contact the core team](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/help/support#email).

## Code of Conduct

### Who is the Code of Conduct for?

The Carbon Design System is built for everybody. While much of the system is built by the Carbon Core team, hundreds of people have contributed. If you use or contribute to Carbon, you are part of this community, and we expect you to adhere to our community standards.

### Feedback and critique

Building great products isn't easy, and there's usually more than one right answer. If you're taking part in any discussion, whether on Slack, Twitter, Gitter, GitHub, or even in person, please respect one another. Keep the mission in mind, and help us make Carbon better.

### Be understanding

Differing needs and differing perspectives make Carbon comprehensive. Be welcoming, be understanding, and be kind. If one user expresses frustrations or complications, there are likely dozens of others who feel the same way. Encourage community members to speak up.
