## Introduction

Carbon is an open source design system. It's free to use for anybody building on the web, and we're always working to make it better. Contributors like you are what make Carbon great, and we're glad you're here.

Contributions don't have to be code. We also encourage feedback, documentation, design, and tools.

All you need is a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to submit. Most contributions begin with a GitHub issue, and that's a great place to start:

* [Ask a question](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+question+%3Aquestion%3A&template=question.md&title=)
* [Request a feature](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement+%F0%9F%92%A1&template=feature-request-or-enhancement.md&title=)
* [Report a bug](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+bug+%F0%9F%90%9B&template=bug-report.md&title=)

### Working with GitHub

Carbon lives on GitHub. All work, discussion, issues, bugs, features, improvements, and comments should happen right out in the open where anybody can see. You'll need a public GitHub account to contribute.

If you need something that we don't already have, or you notice something could be improved, you have two options:

1. You open an issue for the request. We'll review the issue and get back to you with next steps. If we decide the request should be part of our pipeline, we'll add it to our roadmap. There are never timeline guarentees for requests, but we'll do our best to give you an estimate.

2. You can begin the work yourself and contribute it back to Carbon. While we appreciate complete contributions, you're welcome to open an issue to surface your work and we'll weigh in and help when we can.

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, we encourage you to open an issue as early as possible—it's our community works, and the best way we can all stay on the same page.

## Writing an issue

### Contributor License Agreement

The Carbon core team works for IBM. To accept contributions, we need a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) from you before code contributions can be reviewed and merged. If you have questions, please [don't hesitate to reach out](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/help/support#email).

## Code of Conduct

### The core team's promise

Carbon is funded by and built for IBM. Although that means we build for the company's business needs first, it also means we have a brilliant team of engineers and designers working full time to make Carbon better. As one of the world's largest companies, Carbon has thousands of people across the globe using and contributing to Carbon. 

We use what we build, and we're excited you're helping us build it.


### Who is the Code of Conduct for?

The Carbon Design System is built for everybody. While much of the system is built by the Carbon Core team, hundreds of people have contributed. If you use or contribute to Carbon, you are part of this community, and we expect you to adhere to our community standards.

### Feedback and critique

Building great products isn't easy, and there's usually more than one right answer. If you're taking part in any discussion, whether on Slack, Twitter, Gitter, GitHub, or even in person, please respect one another. Keep the mission in mind, and help us make Carbon better.

### Be understanding

Differing needs and differing perspectives make Carbon comprehensive. Be welcoming, be understanding, and be kind. If one user expresses frustrations or complications, there are likely dozens of others who feel the same way. Encourage community members to speak up.
