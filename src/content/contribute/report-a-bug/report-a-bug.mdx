### It's not a bug, it's a *feature*

If you have a bug or an idea, browse the open issues before opening a new one. There may already be something similar in the works. (You can also take a look at the Open Source Guide?? Not sure what this is.) Here is where to find known issues: ** insert link.

To report a new issue, we have templates in Github 

### Questions about usage
If you have a question about how to use a particular component on the site, answers to the most common questions can be found in the [Carbon FAQ](faq).
