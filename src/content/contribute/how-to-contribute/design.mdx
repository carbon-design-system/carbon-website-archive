### Design contributions can take several forms. Most are either enhancements or brand new assets.

## Create something

If you plan to contribute something totally new to Carbon, we recommend you [start with an issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement+%F0%9F%92%A1&template=feature-request-or-enhancement.md&title=). An issue should include a detailed description of the enhancement, including rationale and intended behavior. Mockups and inspiration are also helpful before creating a spec.

We don't want you to waste your time and effort. An issue can be the staging ground for the contribution and an opportunity for the community to weigh in. If the contribution isn't likely to become part of Carbon, we'll let you know.

Don't hesitate to surface works-in-progress. Someone in the community may be able to pick up where you left off.

## Design specs

This spec provides a developer everything they need to create the design in code. Check out our [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines) to get started.

You should also include color tokens and type tokens used. These will be helpful not just in development but also when documenting the work.

## Sketch symbol and docs

Our Sketch kit and docs evolve with the system. Once a design spec is finalized, the contribution needs a Sketch symbol and documentation on the Carbon website. 

#### Docs

If the contribution adds additional behavior or expands a component's features, you'll need to document them with usage guidance, which will go in the usage tab of the component page. Color and type tokens will live in the style tab. 

See our [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines) and the [docs tab](./docs) for help documenting your work.

#### Sketch symbol

Any new assets or changes to existing assets should also live in our Sketch kit. Check out [Sketch's guide](https://www.sketch.com/docs/symbols/creating-symbols/) for creating a symbol. This symbol can be contributed with the asset or enhancement, but must be added to the kit by one of its maintainers.
