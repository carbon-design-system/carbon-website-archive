## Introduction

Carbon is free to use for anybody building on the web, and we're always working to make it better. Contributors like you make Carbon great, and we're glad you're here.

Contributions don't have to be code. We also encourage feedback, documentation, design, and tools.

All you need is a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to submit. Most contributions begin with a GitHub issue, and that's a great place to start:

* [Ask a question](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+question+%3Aquestion%3A&template=question.md&title=)
* [Request a feature](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement+%F0%9F%92%A1&template=feature-request-or-enhancement.md&title=)
* [Report a bug](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+bug+%F0%9F%90%9B&template=bug-report.md&title=)

## Roles and responsibilities

### Users

Users are members of the community who use Carbon guidelines, components, and tooling. Anyone can be a user, and we encourage users to participate in the community as much as possible.

### Contributors

Contributors are members of the community who contribute to Carbon in a material way. Anyone can be a contributor. In addition to participating as a user, they also can contribute by:

- Reporting bugs or missing features through GitHub issues
- Fixing bugs, adding features, and improving documentation

### Maintainers

Maintainers are members of the community who are committed to the success of individual Carbon projects. In addition to their participation as a contributor, maintainers:

- Label, close, and manage GitHub issues
- Close and merge GitHub pull requests
- Nominate and vote on new maintainers

## Working with GitHub

Carbon lives on GitHub. All work, discussion, issues, bugs, features, improvements, and comments should happen right out in the open where anybody can see. You'll need a public GitHub account to contribute.

If you need something that we don't already have, or you notice something could be improved, you have two options:

1. You open an issue for the request. We'll review the issue and get back to you with next steps. If we decide the request should be part of our pipeline, we'll add it to our roadmap. There are never timeline guarentees for requests, but we'll do our best to give you an estimate.

2. You can begin the work yourself and contribute it back to Carbon. While we appreciate complete contributions, you're welcome to open an issue to surface your work and we'll weigh in and help when we can.

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, we encourage you to open an issue as early as possible—it's our community works, and the best way we can all stay on the same page.

## Our process

Carbon Design System projects typically use a [fork and pull request workflow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for contributions. Specific instructions can be found in each project’s GitHub `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
