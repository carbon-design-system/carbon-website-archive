## General guidelines

### Headings

If necessary, a heading can accompany a set of Checkboxes to provide further context or clarity. Use sentence case for Checkbox headings. In the example below, “IBM Designers” would be the heading for the set of Checkboxes below.

### Labels

Always use clear and concise labels for Checkboxes. Be explicit about the action that will follow if the Checkbox is selected. Labels appear to the right of Checkboxes.

### Click target

Users should be able to select the checkbox by clicking on the box directly or by clicking on its label.

### Tables

See the [Data Tables](/components/data-table/usage) section for guidance on how to use Checkboxes within a table.

### Default selection

The default view of a set of Checkboxes is having no option selected.

<div class="image-component">
    <img src="images/checkbox-usage-1.png" alt="The default state for checkboxes is unchecked." />
</div>

_By default, checkboxes are unchecked._
