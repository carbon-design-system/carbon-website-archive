## Content

#### Labels

Both date and time pickers are accompanied by labels, and follow the same accessibility guidelines for all [forms](/components/form).

#### Format

For date pickers, use placeholder text so users input the date in the correct format. It can be formatted in a variety of ways. See the date picker code [documentation](https://github.com/ibm/carbon-components/tree/master/src/components/date-picker) for more info.

## Interaction

#### Calendar widget

It is recommended to use the date picker with a calendar widget when the user is browsing between a range of dates. Aid the user in making the proper choices by providing a visual reference of dates to choose from. The calendar widget appears once the user has interacted with the date input field (typically on `:focus`).

#### Simple date picker

The simple date picker provides the user with a text input in which they can input month/day/year. Simple date pickers are typically used when the date is known by the user, such as a birthday or credit card expiration.

## Time picker

Time pickers provide the user with a text input in which they can input hours/minutes. Additionally, they can be accompanied by an “AM/PM” selection and a time zone selection, which is styled as an [inline select](/components/select).
