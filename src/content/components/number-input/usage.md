## General guidelines

* Do not use Number Inputs when large value changes are expected. They work best for making small, incremental changes that only require a few clicks.
* Enable the user to also choose to type a number in the field.
* Ensure that a default value is shown within the field.
* Use a clear and concise label for the Number Input.
* Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) for the label.
* See further guidance for using number labels within [Forms.](/components/form/usage)
