## General guidelines

The waiting experience is a crucial design opportunity. Although it may not be obvious what is occurring on the back-end, we can communicate clearly to reassure the user that progress is happening.

It is best practice to use a loading spinner whenever the wait time is anticipated to be longer than three seconds.

> “The rhythmic oscillations of tape reels in motion got us thinking about a user’s waiting experience. If a user watches search results load, showing the machine at work relays a sense of efficiency. The swift and even balance of the spinning circles indicates that progress is being made.”

## Size

Loading spinners may be scaled down if the loading experience is contextual to a certain item on the page.
