Components can be considered the “base unit” of the design system. Each component is designed and coded to solve a specific UI problem, such as presenting a list of options, enabling submission of a form, providing feedback to the user, and so on. All of the components in Carbon have been designed to work harmoniously together, as parts of a greater whole.

Component design files are delivered via the design kit, and the code for components is available in the repo for the respective javascript framework.
