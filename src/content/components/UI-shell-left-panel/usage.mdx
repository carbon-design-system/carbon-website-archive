### This left panel is part of the Carbon UI shell. A shell is a collection of components shared by all products within a platform. It provides a common set of interaction patterns that persist between and across products.

## General guidance

The UI shell is made up of three components: The [primary header](/components/UI-shell-header/usage), the left panel, and the [right panel](/components/UI-shell-right-panel/usage). All three can be used independently, but the components were designed to work together.

| Shell UI component      |   |
|-------------|---|
| Header      | The highest level of navigation. The header can be used on its own for simple products or be used to trigger the left and right panels.|
| Left panel  | An optional panel that is used for a product's local navigation.|
| Right panel | An optional panel that shows additional system level actions or content associated with a system icon in the header.|

## Anatomy

The left panel contains secondary navigation and is positioned below the header and fixed to the left. Both links and sub-menus can be used in the side-nav and may be mixed together.

## Behavior

Use the left panel if there are more than five secondary navigation items, or if you expect a user to switch between secondary items frequently. Sub-menus are denoted with a chevron and expand when clicked, pushing the other items down in the panel. To collapse the sub-menu, the user must again click the menu header in the left panel.

The left panel does not support three tiers of navigation. If you have additional content to display beneath a sub-menu, use tabs within the page.
