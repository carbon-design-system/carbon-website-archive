## How to help

### Leave feedback

The best place to leave feedback is [GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose). If you're not already a member, it takes just a minute to [join](https://github.com/join). Carbon offers a few feedback templates, which make sure an issue includes all the information necessary for the team to take a look.

### Fix a bug

If you find something that's broken, you can let us know with [an issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose). If you know how to fix it, and want to make Carbon even better, you can fix the bug and submit a pull request!

1. Find a bug
2. Document the bug with a GitHub issue
3. Fix the bug and submit a pull request

If you're interested in contributing back but don't know of any bugs, you can tackle any of the open issues in [our repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues).

### Add a feature

If Carbon already has a component or pattern you need, but it's missing a feature you need, you're encouraged to expand the asset and contribute back.

1. Design the component or pattern with the feature added
2. Create a specification a developer can act on
3. Build the expanded component in at least one of Carbon's supported frameworks
4. Extend the existing  Sketch symbol
5. Document how to use the componentâ€™s new feature

Feature additions make Carbon better for everybody. If your team needs something, other teams probably do too.

### Create something new

Before a component, pattern, or tool can become a core Carbon asset, each of these steps must be completed (but not necessarily by you).

1. Design the component or pattern
2. Create a specification a developer can act on
3. Build the component in at least one of Carbon's supported frameworks
4. Create a Sketch symbol for the component
5. Document how to use the component or pattern

Steps 1 and 2 must be completed to contribute. All contributions are valuable. If you have a design spec, but lack the time or resources to build it, the community may pick it up.

## Standards

Every contribution must meet the same standards as Carbon assets before it may be added to the system. Follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth contribution process:

#### Accessible

- Is your design [WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) accessible?
- Does your design pass [color contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) ratio?
- Have you considered [keyboard tabbing](/guidelines/accessibility/keyboard) and focus states?

#### Visual style and UX patterns

- Is your design consistent with Carbon's visual style?
- Do your interaction patterns (hover, focus, motion) match Carbon styles?
- Does it use the same color and spacing tokens, as well as type styles and scale?
- Does your design promote clear language and support globalization?

#### Production guidelines

Take a look at our website [production guidelines](https://github.com/ibm/design-system-website/wiki/Production-guidelines) to create documentation consistent with our site.
