## Usage
 
#### Naming

Files should be given useful name by default, especially if you're not allowing the user to edit the file name.

#### File type

A file should be exported in a useful, industry-standard format. If you're giving a user the option to export multiple file types, be sure the types are compatible with your product.

#### Export location

Your user should typically select where a file should be exported. If you're exporting to a location dictated by your application, be sure the location is rational and consistent with other export windows.

## Variants

### Intuitive default name, no location choice, no format options

When the resource is given an intuitive name by default and there is no choice
of export location - export occurs on the click of the Export button and
nothing additional is displayed.
