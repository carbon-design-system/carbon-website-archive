## About patterns

In Carbon, _patterns_ comprise common user flows and scenarios which are too complex or too universal to be encapsulated in a single component. Individual patterns often include two or more components from the system or apply to multiple components independently.

The patterns library is constantly growing, and the Carbon team encourages contributions of UX patterns which can apply to a broad set of Carbon users.

## Carbon patterns

[Common actions](/patterns/common-actions) are frequently used actions that appear multiple times across different components and workflows.

[Disabled states](/patterns/disabled-states) completely remove the interactive function of a component.

[Filtering](/patterns/filtering) is the mechanism by which a user adds or removes data items from a displayed data set.

[Loading](/patterns/loading) is applied when additional information takes an extended amount of time to process and appear on screen.

[Overflow content](patterns/overflow-content) is text, such as a paragraph or a text string, that exceeds a desired space.
