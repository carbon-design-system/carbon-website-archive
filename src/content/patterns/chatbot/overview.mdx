## Common use cases

Bots have become an increasingly popular way to solve common business problems across domains, including:

- **Providing in-context help and guidance** (e.g., scaling a company's FAQ or helping a user get started)
- **Triaging or setting priority of cases** by soliciting information from the user to decrease workload on humans (support tickets, patient symptom severity)
- **Performing common tasks or procedures** (e.g., pay a bill, transfer money, or assist with electing health benefits)
- **Using natural language to search for information** (e.g., find specific information like current balance, or dosing instructions for a medication)

## Why a chatbot?

Before building a bot, make sure that you have justified it as an appropriate solution by asking yourself these questions:

- What are the users' goals?
- How in-depth is the assistance the user will need?
- Is your domain better served by human assistance? 
- How is a bot superior to online documentation, contextual support, wizards, etc.? 
- What kind of data sources or abilities can this bot leverage for your business and your users?

## User needs

#### A user may need:

- Access to help at any time
- An on-demand, relevant answer to a question
- High quality, consistent information about a product or service

#### Within a conversation, a user may need:

- To provide the bot with more context via structured responses
- To know what the bot understands, through reflection and confirming questions
- To identify the most recent and relevant message to improve understanding

#### Don't use a chatbot when:

- A task could be accomplished more efficiently using a traditional user interface
- A process is very complex or could take a long time
- A real human is needed for sensitive or emotional topics
