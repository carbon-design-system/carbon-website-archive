### Justifying Using a Chatbot

Before using this approach, make sure that you have justified it as an appropriate solution by asking yourself these questions*:

- What is the user's goal?
- How in-depth is the assistance the user will need?
- Is your domain something that is better off left in the hands of human assistance? 
- How is a bot superior to "x" (i.e. online documentation, contextual support, wizards, etc...)? 
- What kind of data sources or abilities can this bot leverage for your business and your users?

#### Common Use Cases

Chatbots or bots have become an increasingly popular way to solve common business problems across domains, including.

- **providing in-context help and guidance** (e.g., scaling a company's FAQ or helping a user get started)
- **triaging or setting priority of cases** by soliciting information from the user to decrease workload on humans (support tickets, patient symptom severity)
- **performing common tasks or procedures** (e.g., pay a bill, transfer money, or assist with electing health benefits)
- **using natural language to search for information** (e.g., find specific information like current balance, or dosing instructions for a medication)
