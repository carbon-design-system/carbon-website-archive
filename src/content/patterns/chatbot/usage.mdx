_Please Note: It is important to customize the tone and messaging of your conversation to your product and its users._

### Bot Variants
The chatbot window comes in two variants, Regular and Tight. Use the Regular chatbot window variant when your chat interaction is the main experience and there are few to no other widgets on the screen. Consider pinning the chat window to one side of the screen if more space is required. Use the Tight variant and related symbols when embedding a chat interaction into a larger experience with significant amounts of existing content/information.

### Launching the Bot (Experimental)

Bots should be launched from a clear floating trigger, at the bottom right of the screen, or from a button embedded within the UI. See Carbon Design Kit for the appropriate variants

### Error Notifications

Be sure to indicate to a user when their message has not been sent due to a connectivity or server problem. When in a connected state, remove the notification and any message error indicators.
