### Chatbot elements

#### Chatbot Header

The chatbot header contains the title of the chat and up to four action buttons that control the chatbot application. Typically, the “close” icon must always be included.

#### System Message

System Messages represent what the bot has responded to the user with. Past messages will have a faded treatment, whereas active messages have an indicator applied (see below)

#### Structured Response

Structured Responses present choices to the user that are easy for the bot to understand. When selected, a structured response will change its visual appearance and a user message will appear with the same content.

#### User Message

A user message indicates what the user has input, via voice, text input, or structured response. 

#### Chatbot Input

The Chatbot Input is comprised of a text input field, a button for voice input (optional) and an submit button


### Requesting Information from a Chatbot

The following flow shows a typical exchange between a user and a bot. This model can be used as a baseline to start building useful conversational experiences.

_Please Note: It is important to customize the tone and messaging of your conversation to your product and its users._

### Bot Variants
The chatbot window comes in two variants, Regular and Tight. Use the Regular chatbot window variant when your chat interaction is the main experience and there are few to no other widgets on the screen. Consider pinning the chat window to one side of the screen if more space is required. Use the Tight variant and related symbols when embedding a chat interaction into a larger experience with significant amounts of existing content/information.

### Launching the Bot (Experimental)

Bots should be launched from a clear floating trigger at the bottom right of the screen, or from a button embedded within the UI. See Carbon Design Kit for the appropriate variants.

### Error Notifications (Experimental)

Be sure to indicate to a user when their message has not been sent due to a connectivity or server problem. When in a connected state, remove the notification and any message error indicators.
