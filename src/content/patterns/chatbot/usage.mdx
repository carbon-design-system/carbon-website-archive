### Chatbot Pattern Usage

The following flow shows a typical exchange between a user and a bot. This model can be used as a baseline to start building useful conversational experiences. See the Usage tab to see how to use the Chatbot Components to build these experiences.

_Please Note: It is important to customize the tone and messaging of your conversation to your product and its users._


### Chatbot Window Variants
The chatbot window comes in two variants, Regular and Tight. Use the Regular chatbot window variant when your chat interaction is the main experience and there are few to no other widgets on the screen. Consider pinning the chat window to one side of the screen if more space is required. Use the Tight variant and related symbols when embedding a chat interaction into a larger experience with significant amounts of existing content/information.
