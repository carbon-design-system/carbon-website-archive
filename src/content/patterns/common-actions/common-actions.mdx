### Cancel

Cancel stops the current action and closes the component or item. The user should be warned of any possible negative consequences of stopping an action from progressing, such as data corruption or data loss.

**Usage:** Use a _secondary button_ or a _link_.

</ImageComponent>

### Clear

This action clears data from fields or removes selections. _Clear_ can also delete the contents of a document, such as a log. Typically, the default selection or value is reset for controls that have a default selection or value, such as radio buttons.

**Usage:** Use the `x` icon on the right side of a field, item, or value.

</ImageComponent>

### Close

This action closes the current page, window, or menu. One example is closing a secondary window containing help. _Close_ is also used to dismiss information, such as notifications.

**Usage:** Use the `close` icon, which is typically placed on the upper right side of the element. Do not use _close_ in a button.

### Delete

This action eradicates an existing object. _Delete_ actions cannot be easily undone and are typically permanent. The user should be warned of the negative consequences of destroying an object, such as loss of data.

**Usage:** Use either the `delete` "trash can" icon, a _danger button_, or a danger option in a menu. A _danger modal_ is used when a warning is needed to confirm an action.

### Remove

This action removes an object from a list or item; however, the object is not destroyed as a result of the action. Multiple objects can be removed at once.

**Usage:** Use as a _button_ or `subtract` icon or glyph.

### Reset

This action reverts values back to their last saved state. The last saved state includes the values stored the last time the user clicked or triggered "Apply."

**Usage:** Typically applied as a _link_.
