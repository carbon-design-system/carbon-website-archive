## Checking for known issues

### Github

We use Github to track our public bugs. If you have a bug to report or want to request a new feature, check the [existing issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) before opening a new one. There may already be something similar in the works. 

### Carbon website

Please take some time to explore the content on this website before engaging the Carbon team. The site is very comprehensive and most of the guidelines and components are well documented.

## Creating an issue

### GitHub pull requests

If you have a specific fix or contribution, you can generate a pull request in the appropriate [Carbon repo](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/resources#development-resources). Here are [instructions](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Creating-a-PR-through-github.com-UI) for opening a pull request.

### GitHub issues

Bug reports, feature requests, and general feedback should be delivered to the Carbon team through GitHub issues. If you're unsure which repo to use, open an issue in the [Carbon monorepo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon).
