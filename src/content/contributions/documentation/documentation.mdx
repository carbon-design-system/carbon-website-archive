## Content and style guidelines

The website is written in Markdown, which makes it easy for anyone to contribute content in a systematic way. If you are not familiar with Markdown, check out Carbon's handy markdown [styling cheatsheet](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Markdown-cheatsheet) for how to style content. 

### Content guidelines

Take a moment to review our content writing guidelines. Following these will help us ensure consistency of experience across the site. 

* Aim for a friendly and encouraging tone.
* Speak directly to the user. You can use the second person pronoun ("you").
* Keep sentences and paragraphs short and focused.
* Be clear and concise by removing unnecessary words. The more concise the text, the easier it is for all users to understand.
* Use sentence case for everything, including component names, e.g. Content switcher and Data table.

To learn about writing content for component pages, see our [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#creating-content-for-component-pages). 

## Editing pages

To edit an existing page, use the `Edit this page on Github` links at the bottom of each page on the site. The link opens the specific Github page where you can edit the content and then propose the change with a pull request.

If you have a specific fix or contribution, you can generate a [pull request](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Creating-a-PR-through-github.com-UI).

## Making regular content updates

If you are planning regular or more comprehensive content updates, you'll want to fork the repo and install some of the tools we use to build the website. This will create an easier workflow for you long term. 

Read instructions on how to [install tools](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Updating-content-on-carbondesignsystem.com) and fork the repo.

Read instructions on how to [update content with VSCode](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Update-content-with-VSCode).
