### Design patterns are recurring solutions that solve common design problems and provide a common language for people who create user interfaces


## Creating a pattern

Patterns should solve universal user experience problems. If your pattern applies to a specific product, the pattern likely still applies to other use cases. If you want to contribute, you may need to adjust the guidance to be more general.

Documenting your pattern well makes it easier for other teams to apply it. A Carbon pattern answers the following questions:

* What problem does this solve?
* When should this pattern be used?
* What is the anatomy of the pattern?
* How can this pattern improve accessibility?

#### What problem does this solve?

Patterns typically using a combination of components to solve a problem. Detail the problem and explain why your pattern solves this problem. Understanding how a pattern solves a problem makes correct use more likely.

#### When should this pattern be used?

You've explained what problem the pattern solves. Now, explain when users might encounter this problem. Reiterate, with this context, how the pattern solves the problem. Explaining when not to use the pattern is also useful.

#### What is the anatomy of the pattern?

Outline the distinct parts of your pattern, using images to highlight each part. Assume the names you've assigned each part of the pattern aren't intuitive and include these names in your visuals.

#### How can this pattern improve accessibility?

Accessible components do not make an accessible experience. Include guidance detailing how your pattern can improve the accessibility of an experience. If there are keyboard commands, include those too.
