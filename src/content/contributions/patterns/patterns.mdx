### If you've designed a pattern that is not currently in Carbon, contributing it back allows others in the community to refine and use your pattern in their projects.

## First steps to contributing

The process for contributing a pattern will be depend on the pattern's complexity, but all contributions start by [opening a Github issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new). Include a detailed description in which you:
* Define your pattern and explain the rationale
* Clarify whether it's a variation of an existing component, or a new asset
* Include mockups and/or prototypes of any fidelity
* Include competitive and comparative analysis, and any inspirations from other products

This issue will be the staging ground for the pattern contribution, and you should expect the Carbon core team and the community to weigh in with suggestions at each step.

We encourage you to surface work in progress. If you're not able to complete all of the parts yourself, someone in the community may be able to pick up where you leave off.

## Parts of a pattern contribution

A complete contribution ultimately includes the following parts. 

#### 1. Provide a rationale

Explain how your component will address user needs and solve a problem. Carbon serves the widest possible range of products, and contributions that increase the scope of the system are more likely to be accepted. Be sure to include any research and feedback.

#### 2. Explain behaviors, content structure, and functionality

Provide a comprehensive description in which you: 

* Describe pattern behaviors with descriptions, user flows, or prototypes. 
* Use wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of components. 
* Show the content structure and content elements required, such as title, body, image, labels, video. 
* Include details of how the pattern user experience meets standards for accessibility. 
* Show the pattern in context.

#### 3. Create pattern visuals

Create [high fidelity](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#creating-content-for-component-pages) contextual images that ease use in other products. Evaluate your pattern for [accessibility](/guidelines/accessibility/overview), and user test again.

#### 4. Document the pattern
Create site [documentation](./documentation) that includes your contextual images and step-by-step instructions to effectively implement your pattern. Be sure to include rationale your docs.

#### 5. Prepare for experimental release
If accepted, the pattern will be released as [Experimental](/experimental/about/overview) until community tested and approved for general production.
