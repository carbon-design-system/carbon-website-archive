### If you've identified a pattern in your product that solves a UX problem, contributing the pattern is a great way to help other teams solve similar problems.

## Contributing a pattern

Patterns solve user experience problems. If your pattern applies to multiple instances in your product, it likely applies to similar use cases in other products. If you want to contribute, you may need to adjust the guidance to be more general.

Here is an overview of each phase in the pattern design process. Expect the Carbon core team and the community to weigh in at each step of the process.

To begin, open up a GitHub issue and complete step one below.

1. **Define your pattern in an issue.** Include a problem summary, user needs, an inventory of user research and designs from your product, and
competitive and comparative analysis.
1. **Explain behaviors, content structure, and functionality.** Visualize pattern behaviors, identify content structure, evaluate for
accessibility, and outline requirements.
1. **Visual the pattern.** Create high fidelity, contextual images that ease use in other products. Evaluate your pattern for accessibility, and user test again.
1. **Document the pattern.** Create site documentation that includes your contextual images and step-by-step instructions to effectively implement your pattern. Be sure to include rationale your docs.
1. **Prepare for experimental release.** If accepted, the pattern will be released as Experimental until community tested and approved for general production.
