title: Patterns

### If you've designed a pattern that is not currently in Carbon, contributing it back allows others in the community to refine and use your pattern in their projects.

## First steps to contributing

The process for contributing a pattern will be depend on the pattern's complexity, but all contributions start by [opening a Github issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new). Include a detailed description in which you:
* Define your pattern and explain the rationale
* Clarify whether it's a variation of an existing component, or a new asset
* Include mockups and/or prototypes of any fidelity
* Include competitive and comparative analysis, and any inspirations from other products

This issue will be the staging ground for the pattern contribution, and you should expect the Carbon core team and the community to weigh in with suggestions at each step.

We encourage you to surface work in progress. If you're not able to complete all of the parts yourself, someone in the community may be able to pick up where you leave off.

## Parts of a pattern contribution

Here are all of the steps for a complete contribution. 

#### 1. Provide a rationale

Explain how your component will address user needs and solve a problem. Carbon serves the widest possible range of products, and contributions that increase the scope of the system are more likely to be accepted. Be sure to include any research and feedback.

#### 2. Explain behaviors, content structure, and functionality

* Describe pattern behaviors with descriptions, user flows, and/or prototypes. 
* Use wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of components. 
* Show the content structure and content elements required, such as title, body, image, labels, video. 
* Include details of how the pattern user experience meets standards for accessibility. 
* Show the pattern in context.

#### 3. Create pattern visuals

* Create high fidelity designs and prototypes that follow our [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines). 
* Evaluate your pattern to ensure it meets [accessibility standards and guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/overview), and provide details of compliance.

#### 4. Create design specs

* Create sizing and styling annotations for all of the pattern's components. The design specs should provide a developer with everything they need to create the design in code. Check out our [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines#spec-guidelines) to get started.

You should include color tokens and type tokens used.

#### 5. Create Sketch symbols
* Any new patterns or changes to existing patterns will also live in the [Carbon Sketch kit](/getting-started/designers#get-the-kit) and so you will need to create Sketch symbols for components used. 
* Check out [Sketch's guide](https://www.sketch.com/docs/symbols/creating-symbols/) for creating a symbol. 

#### 6. Document the pattern
* Document pattern guidelines and usage, being sure to include the context and the rationale for any choices. 
* The site [documentation](./documentation) should include your contextual images and step-by-step instructions that allow designers to effectively implement your pattern. 

#### 7. Prepare for experimental release
If accepted, the pattern will be released as [Experimental](/experimental/about/overview) until community tested and approved for general production.
