## Carbon Design Kit

The Carbon Design Kit is a constantly evolving Sketch document containing all of the design system’s visual assets, including components, icons, color palettes, grids, etc. The kit helps you work faster, with confidence that your product or experience is visually aligned with the IBM Design System. It utilizes symbols and text styles, organized via pages in the left side panel of Sketch. When used in conjunction with this site, the Carbon Design Kit provides designers and developers with everything they need to get up and running with Carbon.

### Release schedule

The Carbon core team releases a major update to the system approximately twice a year, including a revised design kit and new versions of the components when needed. Style refinements and bug fixes are released as continuous updates throughout the year. All design kit release updates are tracked in the [change log](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/releases).

## Getting the kit

There are three ways to obtain the kit; via Sketch shared library, via Box Drive, and via GitHub.

### Sketch shared library (preferred)

For timely updates, install the kit as Sketch shared library. _Note: Be sure you have the latest version of Sketch installed on your machine._

### Get the kit via Box (IBM internal only)

If you work with a proprietary add-on library and still want to be connected for updates, set up the kit via Box Drive. Using Box Drive sync will ensure that your design kit file will always be up to date, eliminating the need to manually download new versions as they are released.

1. Follow the instructions on [IBM Digital Design](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/design-kit/) to get the design kit through Box Drive.
2. Once you have installed and gained access to the `IBM Design Kit` folder, navigate to the `product design` folder. Select the desired version of Carbon.
3. When updates are available to the kit library, a purple `Library Updates Available` badge will appear in the top right corner of your Sketch file.
4. Click `Library Updates Available` then `Accept Updates` in the modal.
