## Get the kit

1. **Install Sketch**. To design with Carbon you must have the most recent version of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) installed.
2. **Add libraries**. Designing with Carbon requires subscribing to two libraries: The IBM Design Language kit and the Carbon kit. Click the tiles above to subscribe to each. Both libraries are required.
    - The [Carbon](sketch://add-library/cloud/JaVzz) library contains all Carbon component symbols, color swatches, text styles, and layer styles.
    - The [IBM Design Language](sketch://add-library/cloud/75VZZ) offers fonts, colors, icons, and other resources shared across all embodiments of the IBM Design Language.
3. **Download the grid template**. Click the Grid tile at the top of this page. Once on the [Sketch library](https://sketch.cloud/s/ngV7z) page, choose `Download Document` from the right-side panel. Open the file in Sketch. Navigate to `File → Save as Template...`. You can now access the saved grid template at `File → New file from Template`.

## Start designing

To get started with Carbon, familiarize yourself with the contents of each library.

1. **Start with the grid**. At the top of your screen, navigate to `File → New file from Template` and select your grid template. You'll always be able to find the template here.
2. **Icons and color swatches**. Symbols from both the IBM Design Language library and the Carbon library are accessible from any Sketch document. Navigage to `Insert → Symbols → Carbon Design System` or `IBM Design Language`.
3. **You're all set**. Refer to the content below for a more detailed breakdown of the kit, or head to Sketch to begin designing.

## Anatomy

See the [Sketch library](https://sketch.cloud/s/JaVzz/) page for an overview of the kit.

### Grid

The _IBM 2x Grid_ is the framework for laying out all visual elements in Carbon.

<ImageComponent cols="8" caption="2x Grid overview">

![2x Grid overview](/images/grid-2.gif)

</ImageComponent>

All designs should start with the 2x Grid template. Once you have [saved the grid](#get-the-kit) as a template, navigate to `File → New file from Template` and select the grid template.

See our [layout guidelines](/guidelines/layout) for a more detailed walkthrough of the 2x Grid.

#### Structure

The grid template includes templates for all breakpoints along with the necessary formulas to design for custom screen sizes.

To toggle the grid on and off, use `Control+G`. To toggle the layout guide, use `Control+L`.

### Symbols

Carbon [components](/components/overview), [add-ons](/contributing/add-ons), and [icons](/guidelines/iconography/library) live in the design kit as Sketch _symbols_.

<ImageComponent cols="8" caption="IDL symbol menu navigation">

![Carbon symbol menu navigation](/images/carbon-kit.png)

</ImageComponent>

There are two kinds of symbols — _library symbols_ and _document symbols_. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.

From the `Insert` menu, select `Symbols → Carbon Design System` to add symbols onto your page.

Carbon symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not detach symbols from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer receive updates as they are released.

#### Structure

Symbols are organized by component; after selecting a component, you'll see the variations and states of that component.

- To add the whole component, select the desired variant and place it on your artboard.

- For even more configurablility, use the individual building blocks found under the `Items` folder within the symbol. Be sure your custom design adheres to our [design guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/overview).

### Text styles

_Text styles_ are based on the typography rules that are defined by the [IBM Design Language](/guidelines/typography/overview).

<ImageComponent cols="8" caption="Insert → Text Styles → Carbon Design System">

![Text styles navigation](images/text-styles-1.png)

</ImageComponent>

From the main menu select `Insert → Text Styles → Carbon Design System` to insert a Carbon type token text style.

Text styles within components are carefully considered. We do not recommend detaching the symbol to change default styles.

#### Structure

Carbon text styles in Sketch are organized similarly to symbols.

- The first text style level displays [theme options](/guidelines/themes) (i.e., white theme).
- The second level shows the [Carbon type](/guidelines/typography) tokens (i.e., body-long-01).
- The third level selects the type color, which is labeled with a [Carbon color](/guidelines/color) token name.

### Layer styles

_Layer styles_ are color selections for any shape in Sketch.

<ImageComponent cols="8" caption="Use predetermined overrides when possible">

![Layer styles navigation example](/images/layer-style-1.png)

</ImageComponent>

[Color](/guidelines/color/overview) in Carbon is carefully considered, and we discourage custom layer styles.

The first layer is the theme selection (i.e., 01 White theme). The second layer is core Carbon color tokens (i.e., field-01) for the selected them. The interaction state tokens are nested in a third layer under “state”.

## Info

If you're brand new to Sketch, they offer some great [tutorials and help docs](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/).

### Updates

We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When we make a change to any of the libraries, you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window.

The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.

### Migration

If you're using an older version of Carbon, check out the v10 [migration docs](updates/v10-migration/designers) when you're ready to make the switch.

### Support

Can't find an answer to your question? Open up an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components/issues/new/choose). If you're an IBMer, feel free to reach out on Slack at #carbon-design-system.
