### What is the Carbon Design System?

Carbon is the design system for IBM Cloud products. It is a series of individual styles, components, and guidelines used for creating unified UI.

### Who works on the Carbon Design System?

Carbon has a [core team](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-design-system/people) of designers and front-end developers that are dedicated to developing and supporting the system. Our core team sits in the IBM Design Studio in Austin, Texas. There are also countless other designers and developers who also contribute back to [carbon-components](https://github.com/ibm/carbon-components#contributors) and [carbon-react](https://github.com/ibm/carbon-components-react#contributors).

### How can I contribute and/or propose new components/ideas?

We have contributing guidelines for [Developerss](/getting-started/contributing/developers) and [Designers](/getting-started/contributing/designers). We appreciate you helping out and contributing back.

### Which browsers are supported?

Carbon components is supported in the following browsers:

- IE11
- IE Edge latest
- Firefox latest
- Chrome latest
- Safari latest

### What language are the components written in?

There are two different implementations of the Carbon Design System. One is a Vanilla.js library; that's written in ES6+, SCSS, and HTML and ships deliverables in vanilla javascript in ES5 as well as ES6, CSS, SCSS, and HTML. The other is a React library, that ships a React rewrite of the javascript, but uses the same CSS as the core library.

There is also an unofficial, internal-only [Angular library](https://pages.github.ibm.com/adaniel/angular-carbon-components/) for Carbon Components that was built out by a team other than Carbon. Please note that we **do not** maintain this repo.

### I see a bug, how do I report it?

Please open an issue in the appropriate [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system). We will address the bug as soon as we can. If you have a fix for the bug please feel free to submit a PR for it.

### Why hasn't my bug been fixed yet?

If you have a pressing bug or change it is best to make PR for the issue yourself. Our team works in sprints and will try to address your bug as soon as possible, usually by the following sprint. Issues that are out of scope will be closed until it becomes a higher priority.

### I haven't updated to the latest version of Carbon yet, but I still need the old documentation. Is there a place I can find it?
