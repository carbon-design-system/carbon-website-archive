### What is the Carbon Design System?

Carbon is the design system for IBM Cloud products. It is a series of individual styles, components, and guidelines used for creating unified UI.

### Who works on the Carbon Design System?

Carbon has a [core team](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-design-system/people) of designers and front-end developers that are dedicated to developing and supporting the system. Our core team sits in the IBM Design Studio in Austin, Texas. There are also countless other designers and developers who also contribute back to [carbon-components](https://github.com/ibm/carbon-components#contributors) and [carbon-react](https://github.com/ibm/carbon-components-react#contributors).

### Who can use Carbon?

Anyone! Carbon is an open-source design system that is also the official product and digital design system for IBM. Carbon was originally developed to serve the IBM Cloud business unit, but has since expanded in scope to encompass all product and digital teams at IBM. [Contributions are welcome](/getting-started/contributing) from IBMers as well as the open-source community at large.

### How can I contribute and/or propose new components/ideas?
