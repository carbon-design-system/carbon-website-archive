The **[Carbon Components Angular Library](http://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/)** provides front-end developers & engineers a collection of reusable Angular components to build websites and user interfaces. Adopting the library enables developers to use consistent markup, styles, and behavior in prototype and production work.

## Install

Assuming we're starting with a new @angular/cli project:

```sh
$ npx @angular/cli new my-project --style=scss
$ cd my-project
$ npm i --save carbon-components-angular carbon-components
```

Then we need to include carbon-components in `src/styles.scss`:

```scss
@import '~carbon-components/scss/globals/scss/styles.scss';
```

Thats it! Now start the server and start building.

```sh
$ npm start
```

**Note:** This isn't the only way to bootstrap a `carbon-components-angular` application, but the combination of `@angular/cli` and the `carbon-components` scss is our recommended setup.

### Using our starter app

We recommend using the [carbon-angular-starter](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-angular-starter) for bootstrapping applications with Carbon components. Within 5 minutes your app will be running with the following already configured:

- Angular-cli
- Build process
- Code styles and editor configs
- Folder structure
- Lazy loading
- Routing
- Service workers
- Test framework

Check out the [readme](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-angular-starter) for installation instructions.
