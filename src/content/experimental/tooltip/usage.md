## Usage

### Icon Tooltip

An Icon Tooltip is used to clarify the action or name of an interactive icon button. The Tooltip content should only contain one to two words. Icon Tooltips appear on `hover` and `focus`.

### Definition Tooltip

The primary purpose of a Definition Tooltip is to provide additional help or define an item or term. Therefore, they should contain read-only text that is kept to a minimum. The use of interactive elements, such as Buttons or Links, is discouraged. Definition Tooltips appear on `hover` and `focus`.

### Interactive Tooltip

Interactive Tooltips can contain text and other interactive elements such as a Button or a Link. They appear on mouse `click` and are persistent until intentionally dismissed by clicking outside of the tooltip.
