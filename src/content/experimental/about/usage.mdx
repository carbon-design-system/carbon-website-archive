## Feature-flags

Carbon uses `feature-flags` to toggle new features on and off. We currently have two `feature-flags` available for testing:

- **Experimental Components** use `components-x`
- **UI Shell** uses `ui-shell`.

To turn on either of the feature flags, include the **feature-flag** variable into your SCSS file before importing `carbon-components`, then set `components-x` and/or `ui-shell` to `true`.

```scss
$feature-flags: (
  components-x: true,
  ui-shell: true,
);
@import 'carbon-components/src/globals/scss/styles';
```

*Note: You must be using Sass to take advantage of code using feature flags. The Sass feature flags determine which CSS is compiled.*
