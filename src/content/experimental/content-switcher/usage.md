## General guidelines

The content switcher is used to toggle between two or more content sections within the same space on screen. Only one section can be shown at a time. 

### Text

Be concise and specific. Titles have a max of two words.

### Default selection

Based on usage, there should be a default selection. The default selection is always the first option in a switcher.

### Content switcher vs. toggle 

The content switcher is used for large groups of content, as opposed to the [toggle](/components/toggle) which is meant for a “yes/no” or “on/off” binary decision.
