## ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

# step 4

# Prerequisites

- have done previous steps [link]
- know react at X level

# Objectives

- Create a new component that we woul consider contributing into the carbon codebase
- Test accessibility and verify responsivenessâ€”important part of Carbon!

# Creating the components we need

During this exercise we will implement this section of the page:

[screenshot of section]

We will create a `Section` component and a `PrincipleSectionCard` component.

## Setup

Create a directory for our new component Section and three files:

- `Section.js`
- `section.scss`
- `index.js`

Inside of `index.js`, put:

```
    import Section from './Section'
    export default Section
```

Then inside `src/index.scss` we need to add an import for our new `section.scss` file so that's it's incorporated. Add this import statement to the end of `src/index.scss`:

```
    @import './components/Section/section.scss';
```

## The Section

Looking at our spec â€” we can use semantic html5 element `<section>` to contain our elements. We'll also want a header level 2 to describe the section.

```
    import React from 'react';

    /**
     * The main content is devided into three main sections. Each one containing one or more cards.
     */
    const PrinciplesSection = props => (
      <section className={`bx--row ${props.className} principles-section`}>
        <h2 className="bx--col bx--no-gutter bx--col-sm-4">
          <strong>{props.heading}</strong>
        </h2>
        {props.children}
      </section>
    );

    export { PrinciplesSection };
```

This `PrinciplesSeciton` lets you pass in any number of your own class names via the `className` prop.

**Note:** _You can see above in the `section` and `h2` elements, we are using the grid classes from Carbon._

## The Card

Looking ahead at the rest of the spec we can see there are multiple sections on the page â€” all with varying numbers of cards and images etc we should probably create a second sub-component called SectionCard to keep things tidy and composable rather than adding complexity to our Section component.

Inside of `Section.js`, put:

```
    // Take in a phrase and separate the third word in an array
    function createArrayFromPhrase(phrase) {
      const splitPhrase = phrase.split(' ');
      const thirdWord = splitPhrase.pop();
      return [splitPhrase.join(' '), thirdWord];
    }

    /**
     * The cards inside the page's section. Containing headers and short body paragraphs
     */
    const PrinciplesSectionCard = props => {
      const splitHeading = createArrayFromPhrase(props.heading);

      return (
        <article className="section-card bx--col bx--col-4">
          <h3 className="section-card__heading">
            {`${splitHeading[0]} `}
            <strong>{splitHeading[1]}</strong>
          </h3>
          <p className="section-card__body">{props.body}</p>
          {props.icon}
        </article>
      );
    };

    export { PrinciplesSection, PrinciplesSectionCard };
```

We include an example utility function, `createArrayFromPhrase`, to make the last word in our headings bold.

## Putting the new components into your page

In the appropriate content area of `LandingPagje.js`, paste:

```
    <PrinciplesSection
      heading="The Principles"
      className="landing-page__r3">
      <PrinciplesSectionCard
        heading="Carbon is Open"
        body="It's a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open-source movement. Carbon's users are also it's makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute."
      />
      <PrinciplesSectionCard
        heading="Carbon is Modular"
        body="Carbon's modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. It's components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichevercombination suits the needs of the user."
      />
      <PrinciplesSectionCard
        heading="Carbon is Consistent"
        body="Based on the comprehensive IBM Design Language, every element and component of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences."
      />
    </PrinciplesSection>
```

Now, we can see our cards with content on the page! Next, we need to add the appropriate icons.

## Using icons from `carbon-elements`

`LandingPage.js` is the script file which specifies the content of the page (body copy, etc). So that is also where we will import our icons!

Near the top of `LandingPage.js`, add import statements for each icon you wish to use:

```
    import Globe32 from '@carbon/icons-react/lib/globe/32';
    import PersonFavorite32 from '@carbon/icons-react/lib/person--favorite/32';
    import Application32 from '@carbon/icons-react/lib/application/32';
```

`carbon-elements` provides these as SVGs with accessible markup.

Now, you can put these icons in your component, like so:

```
    <PrinciplesSection
      heading="The Principles"
      className="landing-page__r3">
      <PrinciplesSectionCard
        heading="Carbon is Open"
        body="It's a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open-source movement. Carbon's users are also it's makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute."
        icon={<PersonFavorite32 />}
      />
      <PrinciplesSectionCard
        heading="Carbon is Modular"
        body="Carbon's modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. It's components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichevercombination suits the needs of the user."
        icon={<Application32 />}
      />
      <PrinciplesSectionCard
        heading="Carbon is Consistent"
        body="Based on the comprehensive IBM Design Language, every element and component of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences."
        icon={<Globe32 />}
      />
    </PrinciplesSection>
```

(notice the additional `icon` prop!)

## Adding styles

In `principles-section.scss`, put:

```
    .principles-section > h2 {
      padding-bottom: 2rem;
    }

    .section-card {
      height: 18rem;
      border-left: $spacing-3xs solid $ui-03;
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      position: relative;
      svg {
        position: absolute;
        bottom: 0;
      }
    }

    .section-card__heading {
      margin-bottom: $spacing-05;
    }

    .section-card__body {
      @include type-style('body-short-01');
    }
```

Great! We're using Carbon tokens for measurements and color.

# Accessibility

## Checking in with DAP

We've got quite a bit of new markup on the page â€” now's a great time to check in with DAP and make sure we're on the right track.

Open Chrome dev tools and run the checker. It looks like we've got a violation. Our `<article>` element requires a `<label>` to be accessible. Digging in further it seems like we might be using the wrong semantic element. A humble `<div>` will suffice. ðŸš€ ðŸ§¸ ðŸ˜˜

Inside of `PrinciplesSection.js`, the `return` statement for `PrinciplesSectionCard` can be updated:

```
    â€¦
    return (
        <div className="section-card bx--col bx--col-4">
          <h3 className="section-card__heading">
            {`${splitHeading[0]} `}
            <strong>{splitHeading[1]}</strong>
          </h3>
          <p className="section-card__body">{props.body}</p>
          {props.icon}
        </div>
      );
    â€¦
```
