### IBM Cloud

[Create an IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) if you don't already have one.

### Build for production

Before we deploy our app, we need create an optimized production build

```bash
yarn build
```

### Create manifest file

Create a `manifest.yml` file in the root of the project. You'll need to add your `REACT_APP_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` here.

```bash
---
applications:
 - name: carbon-tutorial
   memory: 64M
   buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git
   env:
   REACT_APP_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: xxxXXX
```

### Create static file

Create a new static file in the root of the project named `Staticfile`. This tells the app to deploy from the `build` folder and not the root of the project.

```bash
root: build
```

### Deploy

Login to IBM Cloud

```bash
cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net -sso
```

Deploy app

```bash
cf push -f manifest.yml
```

You can add a script to your `package.json` file to combine your build and deploy steps

```bash
"deploy": "rm -rf ./build && yarn build && cf push -f manifest.yml"
```

Next time you want to deploy, you can simply run `yarn deploy`.
