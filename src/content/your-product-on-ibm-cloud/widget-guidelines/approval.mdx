## Widget approval


Dashboard widgets have a <b>two-step review process</b>:


### 1. Proposing a service widget 

To propose a new service widget, go to the [Bluemix/core-dev repo] (https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/core-dev/issues) and create a new issue using the widget proposal template. _To propose changes to an existing widget, or an idea for a new core widget, just submit a normal issue._


### 2. Final widget review

Once development and testing are complete, submit the widget for final review by going to the [Bluemix/core-dev repo] (https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/core-dev/issues) and creating a new issue using the widget review template. 


The dashboard team reserves the right to remove widgets with low usage analytics or negative user feedback.


See [Service Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/service-framework?topic=service-framework-user-experience-ux-#ux015-dashboard-widgets) for more details. 

## Final review checklist

### Design


- Widget is intuitive and easy to use
- User value of widget is documented by concept validation and user testing
- Widget meets style guidelines for all widget states
- Illustrations match dashboard illustration style
- Type size and color matches dashboard styles
- Icons do not clash with visual style of dashboard
- Widget tile description meets max character requirements




### DevOpsÂ 


- Widget meets relevant plugin requirements 
- Automated unit testing with >70% code coverage
- Analytics are instrumented for at least click through and loading actions
- Widget uses content caching in local storage* 
- Error, permission and loading states are supported*
- File endpoint is supported for infinite caching with cache busting of js and css bundles
- Shared libraries supported (minimize bundle size)
- Dependencies already deployed to production
- Github repo and contacts for issues provided

*Use utilities provided in [developer guidelines](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/developing/get-coding/console-sdk?topic=onboarding-console-slash-example#console-slash-example)


## Additional Guidance

### Do

- Submit a new widget proposal before starting development
- Focus on user value - if a widget isn't useful, users won't add it to their dashboard
- Follow guidelines on the style tab of this page
- Read the final review checklist before submitting a widget

### Don't

- Don't skip user research when building a widget - even if it's with internal users
