## User-centered product development

### Clarify the 'Job to be Done'

**The 'Jobs to be Done' framework helps a product focus on what the user is trying to accomplish, rather than the steps they are taking to get there.**

For example, the user takes screenshots of your dashboard to use in a monthly report and your team may develop functionality that exports the data in a nicely formatted PDF. This improves the user experience, but doesn't address the user's true job-to-be-done of communicating and collaborating with their team. The team used their time developing a way to print a PDF and not tagging, commenting, saving, and sharing charts within your application.

Product providers can start by talking to real users and mapping the steps taken to complete a job. Look at the tasks users take to achieve their final result. Are there any workarounds? Where are the inadequate solutions?

Understanding these jobs to be done will help your team identify the opportunities that lead to innovative products. Ignoring these opportunities leaves the product stagnant and at risk of losing users to competitors.

### Content as UI (defer to data)

**Your product's UI should defer to data before chrome or passive white space. Strive to put content at the center of your user's interaction with your product.**

Consider when your user needs information and how the importance of information changes for each situation. Reflect this in your UI's information hierarchy and the order you present data. De-prioritize any information that is gratuitous by asking if it is essential, critical, or makes a difference.

Help the user glean insights from your data rather than simply presenting it to them. This helps the user make informed decisions and accomplish tasks more quickly.

## Put the user in control

### Immediate confirmation and progress

**A product should strive to provide immediate results of user actions, or feedback and status if that is not possible.**

A product may not be able to display information or return feedback immediately after a user's input. Jakob Neilson's visibility of system status heuristic is a simple way to build confidence in your product. You can alleviate these pain points by showing the product has received the user's input, indicate that progress is being made, and set the expectation for when to expect a result.

The result of accurate system status is an increase in the user's perceived performance of the product and platform. This helps the user feel in control rather than at the mercy of the system.

## Reduce the user's memory load

### Domain model

**The IBM Cloud platform is a system composed of multiple applications, resources, and platforms working together. Your product should reflect an appropriate domain model and not your org chart or a system model.**

_to do: Explanation of the domain vs system model_

When planning your product's UI, put the emphasis on the tasks the user has to complete rather than business and technical limitations. Forcing the user to learn a new mental model for your product increases the time to productivity and creates a disjointed experience between your product and the platform. Understanding the task helps us develop a better tool. Your product plays a part in the overall system.

Usability is increased when the user understands the domain model. Users can efficiently work within our platform, know what to expect when an action is taken, instinctively navigate the platform, and understand how components work and relate to each other.

### Transferability of learning

**Knowledge the user gains in one part of our platform should be applicable to the rest of the platform.**

Users visit our platform with various levels of familiarity. As the user spends time with our platform they also learn new methods. A product should match the user's knowledge and the experience of the platform to maximize the transferability of learning.

Follow similar patterns and concepts to help the user relate what they already know to your product. When the user must learn new concepts, introduce them in stages and provide supporting documentation for the user who wants to understand more.

If this principle is followed, users will have a much shallower learning curve, be able to get to productive use in a shorter period, and perceive the product as easy to use. This builds confidence in a product and decreases the chance of users abandoning a product that is difficult to learn.

## Support consistency

### Minimize transitional volatility

**Use a navigation and mental model that is consistent with the platform and neighboring products in your user's flow.**

In a 2003 report, David R. Danielson describes transitional volatility as "the extent to which users encounter changes in the Web interface as they move within or between sites."

A product can alleviate the effects of transitional volatility by following a similar application structure and navigation as the rest of the platform. Inconsistency can also come from interactions and how information is displayed. Mapping your user's experience will help you identify harsh transitions that impact your product's experience the most.

Users will be able to quickly move between screens and states in your product when they spend less time getting reoriented. Their expectations for the platform's capability will increase. When there is too much volatility the experience feels disjointed.

##Create aesthetic appeal
**A pleasing visual design will improve a product's perceived quality and usability. A product must balance the aesthetic appeal with other user needs.**

Users are more likely to forgive performance and usability shortcomings when there is an emotional connection to your product.

Basic visual design principles a product should follow:

- Make screen layouts consistent with each other.
- Arrange the screen elements in a way that is sensible and logical and consistent with the user’s conceptual model.
- Incorporate into the composition of the screen the elements of graphic design which contribute to the application’s attractiveness: white space, color, overlap, size and shape differences, pattern, contrast, balance, etc.
