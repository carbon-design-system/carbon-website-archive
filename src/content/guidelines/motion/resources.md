## Motion Generator

IBM Motion implements sophisticated curves and duration. Use the IBM Motion Generator to design accurate and successful motion.

## Motion Design Strategy

Follow these steps to assess your interface for purposeful motion:

1. Define the goals and values of product.
1. Establish information hierarchy within the view.
1. Identify the journey you will guide users through
1. Identify key moments and opportunities for UI motion in the journey. Examples:
    - Give feedback, such as hover states, active states component behaviors, such as opening a drop-down menu
    - Solutions to a UX need, such as reducing cognitive load with progressive disclosure
    - Provide guidance, such as revealing a call to action Primary action button to draw users’ attention
1. Assign or determine either efficient or enthusiastic motion
1. Prototype and test

## Evaluation Checklist

1. Is your motion purposeful?
    - What problem is motion solving?
    - Does it enhance the user experience?

2. Is your motion responsive?
    - Do user actions receive immediate feedback that's seen and felt?
    - Do my micro-interactions use ease-out on user input?
    - Do my micro-interactions fall within a static duration ranging from 60 - 100ms?
    - If there are large, or full screen, transitions in your product, are some elements continuous to guide the user?

3. Is your motion meticulous?
    - Did you use the appropriate easing curves?
    - Is each motion individually considered and choreographed across elements?
    - Are larger elements and motions on smaller screens taking more time than on larger screens?

4. Is your motion unobtrusive?
    - The best interface motion may go unnoticed, because it often keeps users engaged with their tasks. Is your motion frequently noticed by the average users? If so consider removing it, or minimizing it.

5. Is your motion responsive?
    - Check your motion on different screens. In general, the smaller the screen is, the longer the animation should take - this ensures the motion will be perceivable to the user's eye.

## Adaptive Interface Motion Design

Not all devices are powerful enough to smoothly perform all the motion you have designed into the interface, no matter how essential the motion design is. Provide alternatives signifiers for devices with less computing power and users with disabilities. Consider motion-simplified designs for mobil and tablet. Make sure there is always way to communicate the meaning behind a motion statically.
