### With our new bespoke corporate typeface, IBM Plex™, comes a new set of guidance and best practices. Type Specs helps to set up a start point to apply typography—type scales, styles and alignment on screens.

## Type tokens and themes

Carbon uses type tokens and themes to manage typrography.

A _token_ is a named entity in a design system which represents specific visual attributes, such as font size, font weight, color, etc. Using tokens enables these specific values to be centralized and abstracted in the system, which in turn makes it easier to update designs—however wide-ranging—from a single source of truth.

A _theme_ is a complete set of tokens that have been designed to work harmoniously together.

Two different themes in the same system could share the same token architecture, but would have different values for some or all of the tokens.

## Typeface: IBM Plex

Carbon uses the open-source typeface **IBM Plex**. It has been carefully designed to meet IBM's needs as a global technology company and reflect IBM's spirit, beliefs, and design principles. IBM Plex can be accessed and downloaded from the [Plex GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ibm/plex).

### Sans-serif font stack

```scss
font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
```

### Serif font stack

```scss
font-family: 'IBM Plex Serif', 'Georgia', Times, serif;
```

### Mono font stack

```scss
font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', 'Menlo', 'DejaVu Sans Mono',
  'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', Courier, monospace;
```

## Scale

The IBM type scale is built on a single equation. The formula for our scale was created to provide hierarchy for all types of experiences. The formula assumes that y₀=12 px:

<TypeScaleTable />

```
Xn = Xn-1 + {INT[(n-2)/4] + 1} * 2
Xn: step n type size Xn-1: step n-1 type size
```

## Style

Typography creates purposeful texture, guiding users to read and understand the hierarchy of information. The right typographic treatment and the controlled usage of type styles helps manage the display of content, keeping it useful, simple, and effective.

### Weights

Font weight is an important typographic variable that can add emphasis and differentiate content hierarchy. Font weight and size pairings must be carefully balanced. A bold weight will always have more emphasis than a lighter weight font of the same size. However, a lighter weight font can rank hierarchically higher than a bold font if the lighter weight type size is significantly larger than the bold one.

We suggest using IBM Plex Light, Regular, and SemiBold for digital experiences. The semibold weight is ideal for section headers, but should not be used for long text.

### Italic

Each weight has an italic style, which should only be used when you need to emphasize certain words in a sentence (titles of works, technical terms, names of devices, captions, etc.).

## Type color

Type color should be carefully considered, with legibility and accessibility as paramount concerns. Keep type color neutral in running text. Use primary blue for primary actions.
