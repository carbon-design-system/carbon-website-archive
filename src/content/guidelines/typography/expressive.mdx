## IBM Expressive theme

The _Expressive_ theme is for use in editorial and digital marketing experiences at IBM. This theme introduces the new IBM Design Language tokens. Please switch to the new tokens wherever possible.

## Expressive type sets

Even though IBM Plex contains a wide range of scales, it’s important to use curated type sets for a clear and focused reading experience.
