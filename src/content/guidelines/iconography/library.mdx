## About the icon library

This library page is for visual reference only. Please do not copy icons directly from this page for production work. 

For designers, the icons are accessible as a Sketch library via the [IBM Design Language kit](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/design-kit/). For developers, the icons are available via the [Carbon icons package](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-elements/tree/master/packages).

import IconLibrary from '../../../../src/components/IconLibrary';
