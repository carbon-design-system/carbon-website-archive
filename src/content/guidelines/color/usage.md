**Color** brings a design to life. Color is versatile; it's used to express emotion and tone, as well as place emphasis and create associations. Color should always be used in meaningful and intentional ways in order to create patterns and visual cues.

## Color in UI

Carbon uses _themes_ and _tokens_ to manage color. The universal color tokens are defined by common roles and usage, not specific color values. The same color value may be assigned to multiple tokens in a theme even if the values have distinctly different roles. A color token can also have multiple associated roles when the color is used consistently across those roles.

### Color terms

| Term      | Definition                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Value** | A unique color (hex code) assigned to a universal token                                                     |
| **Role**  | The systematic usage/s of a color value                                                                     |
| **Token** | The code identifier for a unique role or set of roles. Tokens are universal and never change across themes. |
| **Theme** | The unique color values assigned to a distinct set of color tokens                                          |
