## Voice and tone

Gone are the days when our users perceive their content experience as complex, distant, or disjointed. We’ve evolved and we now endorse a style that should feel like a conversation between friends – personal, relatable, clear, helpful, and engaging. Conversational style does not mean sloppy writing. It means creating content in a clear, concise way that anyone can understand. It means genuinely connecting with our users.

**Voice** is the foundation for communicating about IBM products and delivering brand messages. At IBM, our voice expresses the core of our personality, while bringing comfort, ease, and a sense of connection to our users. Through careful use of the IBM voice, we help empower users to meet their business goals.

Our goal is to empower our users to meet their business goals. Be consistent with voice across the platform.

#### Tone
Tone conveys your attitude toward what you are writing about and who you are writing to. When you create content – whether it’s introductory text on the UI, an error message, or a topic in the docs – you are essentially a storyteller. Good storytellers are experts in two main areas: what they are saying (the important information that the audience needs to know) and how to say it (the experience that they want to create for the audience). Be a good storyteller.

Content should never feel complex, distant, or disjointed. Rather, it should feel like a conversation with a smart friend – personal, relatable, helpful, and engaging. Do not mistake conversational style for sloppy writing! Conversational content still needs to be clear, concise, and easy to understand. The best content creates a connection with the user.

Here’s how conversational you should be based on the six stages of the user journey:

###Most: 
####Discover, Try, Buy content

“Thanks for joining IBM Bluemix for your free 30-day trial. It’s been great having you! Unfortunately, your Bluemix trial account, with IBMid name@domain, is now deactivated because your trial is over. While your account is deactivated, you can’t access resources. Don’t worry, your apps are not deleted.”

###More: 
####Getting started content (for example, welcome), content for remaining experiences (Productive Use, Manage and Upgrade, Leverage and Extend, Get Support)

“To start using Bluemix, name your first organization. Think of an org as a project or team that shares resources, such as apps, databases, and other services. Orgs exist in geographic regions, so decide where you’d like to put your first one.”

###Less: 
####Instructional content (steps) for how to complete a task

“Watson Assistant comes pre-trained with industry-relevant content. It can make sense of your historical chat or call logs, and it has a visual dialog editor — meaning it's never been easier to get started (developers not required).”
