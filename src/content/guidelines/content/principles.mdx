## Principles

Guidelines are not rules. Follow them wisely, and stray when necessary. Writing should be fun! If you're not enjoying yourself, your user isn't either.

### Keep sentences short

Content should be scannable and easy to read. Long sentences give way to complicated punctuation and big words. Content should be accessible by everybody, regardless of reading level.

### Use simple words

Big ideas call for little words. Your content should be easy for anybody to read. Say it simply and say it clearly. Let your product speak for itself.

### Be consistent

It would be strange if someone's personality and voice changed thorughout a conversation. It's just as strange when using a product.

### Speak directly to your user

Your user is the only person that matters when writing for UX. Be a good tour guide. Show them what really matters, step back, and let them explore.

### Be friendly, even conversational

The voice you bring to a product has a huge impact on the user's experience. Determine how you would speak to the user in person, and go for that. Well, within reason.

### Encourage action

It's a lot cooler to visit Rome than it is to read about it. Encourage your user to start using your product as quickly as possible.

### Be confident

If you need a user to do something, don't be shy. Avoid **shoulds** and **cans**. Embrace **do**.

### Avoid slang

If your mom wouldn't understand a word, it's probably not dope. If a user's first language isn't English, even 'uh-ohs' and 'ums' can take away from an experience.


## Language and grammar

### Use standard US English spelling

Use standard US English spellings.

Tip: We can all make typos or forget how to spell a particular word, so always run your UI text through a spell checker. It's also always worth getting someone else to review your copy before it gets published.

There are many words that have different spellings in non-US English than they do in standard US English. See the [Glossary](/glossary) for a list of Commonly confused US / non-US English spellings and guidance about How to refer to UI elements. [is this correct?]

### Use contractions

Users don't want to read more characters than necessary and we want to present a conversational style. Use simple, commonly understood contractions.



However, avoid complex contractions that involve combining more than two words.
