## Every word matters.

### Write your content for everybody.

### Keep sentences short

Content should be scannable and easy to read. Long sentences give way to complicated punctuation and big words. Content should be accessible by everybody, regardless of reading level.

### Use simple words

Big words destroy big ideas. Your content should be easy for anybody to read. Say it simply and say it clearly. Let your product speak for itself.

### Be consistent

It would be strange if someone's personality and voice changed thorughout a conversation. It's just as strange when using a product.

### Speak directly to your user

Your user is the only person that matters when writing for UX. Be a good tour guide. Show them what really matters, step back, and let them explore.

### Be friendly, even conversational

The voice you bring to a product has a huge impact on the user's experience. Determine how you would speak to the user in person, and go for that. Well, within reason.

### Encourage action

It's a lot cooler to visit Rome than it is to read about it. Encourage your user to start using your product as quickly as possible.

### Be confident

If you need a user to do something, don't be shy. Avoid **shoulds** and **cans**. Embrace the **do**.

### Avoid slang

If your mom wouldn't understand a word, it's probably not dope. If a user's first language isn't English, even 'uh-ohs' and 'ums' can take away from an experience.
