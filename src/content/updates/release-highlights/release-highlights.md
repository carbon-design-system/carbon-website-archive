## Exciting changes

The Carbon team is excited to announce the upcoming release of Carbon X, a major update to IBM's open-source design system.

### New look for Carbon

The new IBM Design Language represents a complete overhaul of IBM’s design ethos. Designed from the ground up as a unified, flexible, and expressive set of principles, guidelines, and assets, the new design language redefines the essence of “IBM Design.”

### Redesigned website

With an all-new look and feel based on the new IBM Design Language standards, the Carbon website is better than ever. The site features improved information architecture, a new Help section, and faster performance, ensuring that users can find exactly what they need in record time.

### New components

While these experimental components are not yet production-ready, they are available for experimental use by designers and developers in preparation for their upcoming general availability in 2Q 2019. These components are the functional embodiment of IBM Design Language at the product level, and can be found in the experimental design kit, as well as on the Carbon site.

### Revised Guidelines

Carbon's design guidelines have also been revised to reflect the new IBM Design Language. Guidance on color, layout (including the “2x” grid system), typography, iconography, motion, and more has been updated to “Duo” standards, ensuring that all users can start with a solid foundation as they design and develop digital products and experiences.

### Updated Accessibility Guidelines

Carbon X comes with revised accessibility guidelines for 2019, including new guidelines for color and keyboard interactions.
