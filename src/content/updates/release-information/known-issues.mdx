## Carbon v10 identified bugs and issues

Here are the most significant issues and problems that we are aware of in the Carbon v10 release. The Carbon team will be working to resolve these.

We also welcome pull requests. If you find and issue and fix it, we'd be delighted to welcome you as a Carbon contributor!

### Post-release updates

All our Github repositories have a `v10-update` milestone, which includes all the issues we have identified as most urgent.

If you use Zenhub, you can see all those issues on a single [v10-update milestone board](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/milestone/6).
