## Overview

This is the roadmap for the Carbon Design System, based on our planned design and development path. It is not a delivery commitment and is subject to change based on user needs and feedback.

## Q4 2018

### Inspiring visual design

#### Layout

- Guidance on how to use the _mini unit_ (mu). Make the mini unit a constant token.
- Guidance on how to use a consistent scaling multiplier to size boxes.
- Add support for 16-column grid.
- Convert the Carbon grid to 2 mu gutter.

#### Color

- Show the core colors for use in a UI, with accessible interaction states.
- Explain when I can open all the presents in the color palette.

#### Icons and illustration

- Show the shape elements shared by typography and icons.
- Guidelines for creating a new icon.
- Blending shape elements and color for creative illustrations that share a visual language.

## Q1 2019

### Contribution and adoption

#### Bringing in specific contributions from other IBM teams

- Experimental flex-size components.
- Sharing CSS with [Carbon Angular](/getting-started/developers/angular).
- Guidelines for composite components.

#### Making more reasons to contribute

- Create and distribute **swag** to contributors; credits on site/GitHub; posters, T-shirts, socks, Carbon Conference tickets.

## Q2 2019

### Pattern library

Prioritize the most important compound components, layouts, and workflow patterns. Encourage bringing these in through contribution from extended teams.

- Publish on the website the full list of **all** components that we propose, even if 0% complete.
- Prioritize and solicit contributions based on follows and upvotes for components.

#### Compound components

- Cards
- Condition builder
- Reporting
- File uploader
- Calendar/scheduler
- Data visualization

#### Page templates

- Home page
- Dashboard page
- Detail page
- Profile page
- Catalog page
- Billing and usage page
- Management page
- Docs page
- Legal

#### Workflow patterns

- Login
- First-time use
- Registration

- What's new
- Embedded help
- Provisioning
- Upgrading

### UI Software Development Kit (SDK)

- Provide a developer with all the tooling and components needed to build a full UI - sharing common shell/chrome/panels and other layout clues.
- Make that UI framework SDK universal for any UI.
