# Principles

These core principles drive everything we design at IBM. By relentlessly focusing on our users and their needs, we can ensure that our products and experiences deliver useful, meaningful, and delightful outcomes.  

## Be essential

Every element in an experience should have a purpose. Strive to make complex processes and problems feel as simple as possible. Provide all the necessary information in a sleek and elegant way, so we can be distinct, clear, and concise for our users. Embrace the spirit of “just enough design.”

## Be inclusive

Good design should work for everyone. Keep in mind that the people using your products will be extremely diverse in capabilities, situations, needs, and aspirations. Empathize with a full spectrum of potential users. When we design with inclusivity in mind, everybody wins. 

## Be consistent

Consistency does not mean exact replication. Rather, it's a harmonious uniformity, instilling predictability and stability in the user experience. Inconsistent experiences create confusion and frustration. Consistency inspires comfort and trust.

## Be humanistic

More than being user-centered, we must be human-centered. We start from a deep understanding of the people using the product, their needs, and their goals. Core to the humanistic approach is embracing empathy—the ability to understand and share another personʼs perspective, feelings, and challenges. Go out of your way to identify with, and cater to, your users' needs. 

## Be delightful

Engage users with inspiration and curiosity by designing experiences to encourage critical thinking and creative confidence. Be mindful of usersʼ time by providing them with the right tools at the right time. Take an experience that users normally find tedious and make it easy. Maybe even fun.
