**Links** are used primarily as a navigational element. Links may also change what or how data is displayed (view more, show all). If the action taken by the user will change or manipulate data, use a button.

<component 
    name="Link"
    component="link" 
    variation="link"
    codepen="YErzrq"
    hasReactVersion="true"
    >
</component>
