title: Roadmap
---

This is the roadmap for the Carbon Design System, based on our planned design and development path. It is not a delivery commitment, and it is subject to change based on user needs and feedback.

## Q4 2018

### Inspiring Visual Design

#### Layout

- Guidance on how to use the mini unit (mu). Make the mini unit a constant token.
- Guidance on how to use a consistent scaling multiplier to size boxes.
- Add support for 16-column grid.
- Convert the Carbon Grid to 2mu gutter.

#### Color

- Show the core colors for use in a UI, with accessible interaction states.
- Explain when I can open all the presets in the color palette.

#### Icons and Illustration

- Show the shape elements shared by typography and icons.
- Guidelines for creating a new icon.
- Blending shape elements and color for creative illustrations that share a visual language.

## Q1 2019

### Contribution and Adoption

#### Bringing in specific contributions from other IBM teams

- Experimental flex-size components.
- Sharing CSS with [Carbon Angular](/getting-started/developers/angular).
- Guidelines for composite components.

#### Making more reasons to contribute

- Create and distribute **swag** to contributors; credits on site/github; poster, T-shirt, socks, Carbon Conference ticket.

## Q2 2019

### Pattern Library

Prioritize the most important compound components, layouts, and workflow patterns. Encourage bringing these in through contribution from extended teams.
