**Checkboxes** are used for a list of options where the user may select multiple options, including all or none.

### Checkbox States

The checkbox control allows for three states: **selected**, **unselected**, and **indeterminate**. The indeterminate state comes into play when the checkbox contains a sublist of selections, some of which are selected, and some unselected.

### Checkbox vs. Radio Button

Whereas radio buttons represent a group of _mutually exclusive_ choices, users can select one or more checkboxes from a group. In use cases where only one selection of a group is allowed, use the radio button component instead of the checkbox.

### Checkbox vs. Toggle Switch

Generally, toggle switches are preferred when the resulting action will be instantaneously applied, without the need for further confirmation. Checkboxes generally represent one input in a larger flow which requires a final confirmation step.

### Headings

If necessary, a heading can accompany a set of checkboxes to provide further context or clarity. Use sentence case for checkbox headings. In the example below, “IBM designers” would be the heading for the set of checkboxes.

### Labels

Always use clear and concise labels for checkboxes. Be explicit about the results that will follow if the checkbox is selected. Labels appear to the right of checkboxes.

### Click target

Users should be able to select the checkbox by clicking on the box directly or by clicking on its label.

### Tables

See the [Data Table](/components/data-table/usage) section for guidance on how to use checkboxes within a table.

### Default selection

The default view of a set of checkboxes is having no option selected.

<div class="image-component">
    <img src="images/checkbox-usage-1.png" alt="The default state for checkboxes is unchecked." />
</div>

_By default, checkboxes are unchecked._
