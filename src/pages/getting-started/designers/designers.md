This site, along with the Carbon Design Kit, provides designers with everything they need to get up and running with Carbon.

## Carbon Design Kit

The Carbon Design Kit is a constantly evolving document that contains all of the design system's visual assets, including components, icons, color palettes, grids, etc. When used properly, the kit should help you work faster, with confidence that your product or experience is well aligned with the IBM Design System. It utilizes symbols and text styles, organized via pages in the left side panel of Sketch.

The design kit is available to the public through GitHub and internally to IBMers through Box Drive. The kit can be used directly in the Sketch application or loaded as a Sketch library source.
