You can specify the pattern for the text input to make sure the user enters the correct date format. The default regex pattern that ships with the\\nsimple date picker is \\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{4} (&#39;dd/yyyy&#39; for short date pickers) and \\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{1,2}/\\\\d{4} (&#39;dd/mm/yyyy&#39; or mm/dd/yyyy). The simple date picker does not require any JavaScript.</p>\\n<p><strong>The single date picker</strong> is a text input with a calendar instance attached to it. It also ships with a calendar icon inside the input field. The calendar will open when the input is focused, and the user can both type in a date or select a day from the calendar. The single date picker requires JavaScript, so the data attributes <code>data-date-picker</code> and <code>data-date-picker-type=&quot;single&quot;</code> are required on the parent div, and the data attribute <code>data-date-picker-input</code> is required on the input field.</p>\\n<p><strong>The ranged date picker</strong> has two text inputs with a ranged calendar instance attached to them. The ranged date picker requires JavaScript, so the data attributes <code>data-date-picker</code> and <code>data-date-picker-type=&quot;range&quot;</code> are required on the parent div, and the data attributes <code>data-date-picker-input-from</code> and <code>data-date-picker-input-to</code> are required on the two input fields.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"localization\\\">Localization</h4>\\n<p>Date Picker supports localization, and you can specify the date format by overriding the component option <code>dateFormat</code>.
